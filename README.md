# How to code.

  This project was set up using
[this](http://thesassway.com/beginner/getting-started-with-sass-and-compass)
article. Basically you should do `gem
install compass`. Then you'll be able to
execute the `compass watch` command over this
directory to start checking changes in the
`sass` folder.

# Installing.

  Should be installed in `.sites/all/themes/`.
